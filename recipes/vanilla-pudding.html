        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Large egg yolks</li>
            <li>&frac13; cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp softened butter</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Get Thick</h3>
                <p>
                Put your eggs in a heatproof bowl, beat them and set them 
                aside. In a 2 quart saucepan, mix your sugar, cornstarch 
                and salt. Pour in the milk gradually to avoid lumps and put
                over medium heat. Stir the milk mixture constantly until it
                gets thick and starts boiling.
                </p>

            </li>
            
            <li>
                <h3>Temper the Yolks</h3>
                <p>
                Here's the deal, we need the richness and thickness that
                our yolks can supply, but if we direct deposit those little
                guys into our hot milk, they'll cook right up. We'll end
                up with milk-poached egg yolk instead of rich, thick pud.
                So we need to be smart. Take half of the hot milk, and
                gradually stir it into the egg yolks. Once that is combined
                we can add it back into the main saucepan. Let it boil and
                sit together for 1 minute, and then remove it from heat.
                Finish it off with the butter and vanilla.

                <h3>Chill</h3>
                <p>
                If you like warm pudding good for you, but I have deep
                psychological hang ups that prevent me from indulging in
                such things. Divvy up your goop into dessert dishes and
                cover them with plastic to prevent a skin from forming.
                They should chill in the fridge for at least an hour.
                Pudding you don't immediatly consume in your gluttony
                can be stored covered in the fridge for as long as you're
                brave enough to eat it.
