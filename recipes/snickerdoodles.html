        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 &frac12; cups granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 &frac34; cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>&frac12; tsp salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For coating:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>&frac14; cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 &frac12; Tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Prep and Warm-Up:</h3>
                <p>Preheat your oven to 350&deg;F (175&deg;C) and line your baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly greasing them will also work.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The Dry Team:</h3>
                <p>Combine cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, and flour in a medium bowl and set aside for later.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The Cream Team:</h3>
                <p>Using a stand mixer (a hand mixer will work too) combine the butter and sugar and whip until light and fluffy. Be ready to spend about 2 minutes to get the right consistency. Afterwards, add the eggs and vanilla and mix well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Balls:</h3>
                <p>Combine the wet and dry ingredients, and mix well. Once the dough is created shape it into little balls. If your balls feel sticky you can chill them in the fridge for 20 min, but it's not required.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Cover The Balls:</h3>
                <p>Blend together the &frac14; cup sugar and 1 &frac12; Tbsp cinnamon in a small dish or bowl. Roll the dough balls in the cinnamon/sugar to coat them well before putting them on the baking sheet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Let &#x1F44F; Them &#x1F44F; Cook &#x1F44F;:</h3>
                <p>Bake the cookies at 350&deg;F for 8-10 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let them cool for a couple minutes before moving them to a wire rack to prevent soggy bottoms.</p>
