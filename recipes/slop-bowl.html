            <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
            <li>&frac34; cup greek yogurt or sour cream</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil (I like olive oil)</li>
            <li>1 Packet taco meat seasoning</li>
            <li>Hot Sauce</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Sweet Potatoes</h3>
                <p>
                Peel and dice your sweet potato into bite-sized cubes 
                and put them into a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil 
                and add any seasonings you choose. Toss to cover the 
                potatoes thoroughrly and put them in an air fryer at 400&deg;F 
                for 15-20 minutes, tossing them about every 10 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Turkey Meat</h3>
                <p>
                Warm up your pan or skillet to medium heat and add your
                ground turkey and seasoning packet. You may need to add 
                some water or stock if the directions on the seasoning 
                calls for it or if the meat looks too dry. Cook until 
                the meat reaches an internal temprature of at least 
                165&deg;F. I trust you.
                </p>
            </li>

                <h3>Assembly</h3>
                <p>
                Once your meat is finished, put your potatoes into a 
                soup bowl, put as much meat on top as you can fit 
                (usually &frac13; to &frac12; of a pound). 
                Dollop with greek yogurt or sour cream and finish it 
                off with a dose of your favorite hot sauce.
                </p>
